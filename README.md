# GrimPlaceLive
The Repository that hates the shrinkth of rplace.live

at 4-1, the rplace.live became offline and started to resetted.
at 4-2, darkplace.live, the worst event started, the colors of the startup was reminding me turkey flag. it was the death of original rplace.live, every users started to post a #BringBack32Palette.
and now, 5-23, people started to hate the expansion. 
The issue [#278](https://github.com/rslashplace2/rslashplace2.github.io/issues/278) started to get resolved, but we still want 32 colored palette.
# Let's End darkplace.live
obviously the 750x750 canvas was literally started as darkplace.live, a dumbest april fools prank of rplace.live
so we shall end it. we must end the darkplace.live before the deadline.
Dead Line: July 20 2024.
Note: if it fails, [Infinite Place Anarchy 2019](https://Outfit8TSB.github.io) Cannot start at 7.20.2024 due to the delay.
Make July 20, a Great day of Central Alliance & Rassicas Alliance. May God Bless Central Alliance and Rassicas Alliance.
